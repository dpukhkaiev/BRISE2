## Using Kubernetes 
To deploy BRISE onto the Kubernetes cluster you must first create it, please consult one of the tutorials: 
[tutorial1](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) or 
[tutorial2](https://www.tecmint.com/install-kubernetes-cluster-on-centos-7/) to configure your own cluster.

Having a functioning K8s cluster, use`brise.sh` with mode `k8s` to setup BRISE-related services (manually). 
In all scenarios you would require at least the `event-service` and `mongo-db.`

Under the hood, the script builds images for specified services, pushes them to the specified `docker-hub` 
(should be local to protect private info) and builds relevant `k8s services` (the orchestrator decides where to 
run each service).

After that, you are able to use the services (via the management portal or just by sending requests via `RabbitMQ`).

Be aware that if you use `brise.sh` control script to deploy BRISE on K8s,
the master-node of your cluster will need to connect to the **local** `Docker hub` where images of BRISE services 
will be stored and the domain name of the `docker hub` in the cluster and on the host machine must be the same.
See details in the use case for `minikube`.

Also, for K8s deployment, user should be authorized to execute `kubectl` commands.

### Use cases
#### Everything in the remote cluster

![Variant 1](./img/use_case_1.png)

- Login in the `master-node` via the ssh: `ssh user@IPMaster`.
- Delete existing services: `./brise.sh down -m k8s` 
- Run `./brise.sh up -m k8s -e event-service -db_port 27017 -db_host mongodb://mongo-db`
- Wait until all services will run stable.
- Find the `main-node` pod full name, by using the dashboard or `kubectl get pods`. 
- Run `python3.7 main.py ./relative/path/to/config/file.json` in the `main-node` pod. You can use the dashboard to 
run the command or `kubectl exec -it main-node-xxxxx -- command`.

#### Workers, worker service, mongo-db and the event service in the remote cluster

![Variant 2](./img/use_case_2.png)

- Login in the `master-node` via ssh: `ssh user@IPMaster`
- Delete existing services: `./brise.sh down -m k8s`
- Run `./brise.sh up -m k8s -e event-service -db_port 27017 -db_host mongodb://mongo-db -s event_service worker_service worker mongo-db`
- Wait until services will run stable.
- Bind local ports to the cluster ports (on `master-node`) where event service runs AMQP and GUI service, and database runs:
 
    `ssh -L 30153:master-node:30153 user@IPMaster` - to bind AMQP port
    `ssh -L 30154:master-node:30154 user@IPMaster` - to bind GUI port
    `ssh -L 30156:master-node:30156 user@IPMaster` - to bind database port

- Run the `main-node` service in a local Docker container and specify event service hostname (IP), ports for AMQP and GUI service and database-related information:

    `./brise.sh up -m docker-compose -eAMQP 30153  -eGUI 30154 -db_host mongodb://localhost -db_port 30156 -s main-node`

Additionally, for debug purposes you may want to run the `main-node` (or any other service) on the local machine 
without using `brise.sh` and a Docker container.
To do so, specify the next environment variables on your local machine:

 - `BRISE_EVENT_SERVICE_AMQP_PORT` - as AMQP port of RabbitMQ service
 - `BRISE_EVENT_SERVICE_HOST` - as IP or domain name of RabbitMQ service
 - `BRISE_DATABASE_HOST` - as IP or domain name of the BRISE database
 - `BRISE_DATABASE_PORT` - as port of the BRISE database
 - `BRISE_DATABASE_NAME` - as name of the BRISE database
 - `BRISE_DATABASE_USER` - as user of the BRISE database
 - `BRISE_DATABASE_PASS` - as password for the BRISE database user

After that, you can run any services by using python commands.

`NOTE. The host networking driver only works on Linux hosts and is not supported on Docker Desktop for Mac, Docker 
Desktop for Windows, or Docker EE for Windows Server. To test this variant on a Windows machine, you can run the 
main-node locally as for debugging purposes.`

#### Everything in the local(minikube) cluster

![Variant 3](./img/use_case_3.png)

An important detail, in your cluster and on a machine where you run `brise.sh` the Docker hub hostname must be the same.
Therefore, in the next guide, the DNS name `hub` is used as the Docker hub hostname.

On your local machine:
- Create a minikube cluster according to the guide: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/
- Get a minikube IP. Run `minikube ip`
- Setup an IP for `hub` to the value of `minikube ip` in the DNS records.
- Setup an insecure-registry for your Docker daemon to successfully push images.
    1. Run `sudo systemctl edit docker`.
    2. Set `--insecure-registry` to the minikube IP. An example of the file:
        ```
        [Service]
        ExecStart=
        ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --insecure-registry hub:5000
       ```
     3. Reload the Docker daemon: `systemctl daemon-reload`
     4. Restart Docker `systemctl restart docker`
 - Again run `minikube start` (if it stops because of Docker restart)
 
In the minikube cluster (run `minikube ssh`):
- Install a local Docker hub repository:
    2. Run `docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2`
    3. Setup IP for `hub` as `127.0.0.1` in the DNS records.
    4. Exit from minikube. Run `exit`

On your local machine:
- Use `brise.sh` file to run commands on the machine:
    `./brise.sh up -m k8s --k8s_docker_hub_name hub -s event_service worker_service`


### Some useful commands and information

##### Dashboard related information

Kubernetes Dashboard should be installed in your cluster. To run it use `kubectl proxy` command, 
and the dashboard will be accessible on the `8001` port.

To get access to the GUI of the dashboard, follow the next steps:
 - Connect to the master node of the cluster: `ssh user@IPMaster`
 - Run the proxy service: `kubectl proxy`
 - Open the GUI link in your browser. Please note, the dashboard is accessible only locally on the `master-node` 
 on the next address: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/`.
 - If you would like to open the dashboard from a remote machine you have to forward the local 
 traffic from the master node. To do it use ssh port binding.
    1. The next command binds 9999 local port with  8001 `master-node` port: 
        `ssh -L 9999:127.0.0.1:8001 user@IPMaster`.
    2. After that the dashboard is accessible from your local machine on the next address:
`http://127.0.0.1:9999/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/`
 - To login into the dashboard use a token authorization mechanism. To get the token run the next command:
 `$ kubectl -n kube-system describe secret $(sudo kubectl -n kube-system get secret | 
 (grep k8sadmin || echo "$_") | awk '{print $1}') | grep token: | awk '{print $2}'`
 - In case the Database is unreacheable, e.g., after a new deployment, the respective user has to be created with the 
 command: `$ mongo --eval 'var db = connect("mongodb://localhost/BRISE_db"); 
 db.createRole({role: "user",privileges: [{actions: [ "find", "update", "insert" ],
 resource: { db: "BRISE_db", collection: "" }}],roles: [  ]});
 db.createUser({user: "BRISEdbuser",pwd: "yourPassword",roles: [ { role: "user", db: "BRISE_db" } ]})'`

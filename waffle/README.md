# Waffle
Waffle is a feature modeling language enabling configuration of BRISE.

This module contains a front-end for the configuration process available at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

The workflow with this module is the following:
1. Launch BRISE as described in [the main Readme](../README.md#using-brise) 
2. Submit your feature model into the initialization window.
3. Walk through the configuration wizard steps. 
4. Put resulting `Json`-file into [main_node/Resources](../main_node/Resources) directory.

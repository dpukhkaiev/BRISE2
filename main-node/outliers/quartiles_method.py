			The rules of the method are as follows:
			1. The IQR (Inter Quartile Range) is the distance between the lower (Q1) and upper (Q3)
			quartiles.
			2. Inner fences are located at a distance 1.5 IQR below Q1 and above Q3 [Q1-1.5 IQR,
			Q3+1.5 IQR].
			3. Outer fences are located at a distance 3 IQR below Q1 and above Q3 [Q1-3 IQR, Q3+3 IQR].
			4. A value between the inner and outer fences is a possible (minor) outlier. 
			An extreme value beyond the outer fences is a probable (major) outlier. 

			There is no statistical basis for the reason that Tukey uses 1.5
			and 3 regarding the IQR to make inner and outer fences. 

			In this implementation only outer fences are used, because they are probable outlier (step 2 is skipped)
